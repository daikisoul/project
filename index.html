                <p>A malevolent cosmic force devoid of all emotion, that seeks the complete destruction of civilization, It is a form of chaos that has existed since creation, The "Honkai" cannot be bargained with, it can't be touched or can be communicated with, and manifests itself in many irregular forms that plagued humanity ever since the dawn of evolution of humanity's technological advances progressed.</p>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>In the universe of Houkai there exists the "Tree of life" and the "Sea", The Tree would drink from the Sea and sustain itself for an Immeasurable amount of "time" and grow an innumerable number of branches and leaves, while the Sea seeks to flood the Tree, in the Tree and the Sea's rivalry for dominance from one another, a bud sprouted and that was when the concept of "Civilization" was born. Now every branch is an alternate world of "Civilization" and the Sea and Tree watches as it continuous to grow, but in that growth of Civilization came a malignant force that existed between the Sea and the Tree's Rivalry, as the omnipresent force that seeks the destruction of civilization, it was come to know later as the "Honkai".</p>

                    <p>The presence of Honkai can be dated back to the beginning the PE-era (Previous-era) spread of a contagious virus, they were known as Incurable diseases that caused the physical body to grow purple stripes and turn the entire body grey-white, moments after the pathogen has spread throughout the body, body failure soon begins, as the pathogen eats away the presence of matter & cells in the living body even causing permanent blindness or even death. while Identifying this pathogen discovering that the virus itself is incurable they later named it as the "honkai sickness" referring to disintegration or collapse of the abstract matter.</p>
